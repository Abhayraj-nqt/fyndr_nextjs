        <li>
          Binding Arbitration . Except as specifically stated herein, any
          dispute or claim between you and Fyndr and/or its subsidiaries,
          affiliates, and/or any of their respective members, officers,
          directors, and employees (all such entities collectively referred to
          herein as the “Fyndr Entities”) arising out of, relating in any way
          to, or in connection with the Terms of Use, the Site or your use of
          the Site, your Personal Information, or any Products or Business
          Offerings (“Dispute(s)”) shall be resolved exclusively by final,
          binding arbitration; except that you may bring a qualifying claim over
          a Dispute in a small claims court. By virtue of this Dispute Agreement
          (defined below), you and Fyndr are each giving up the right to go to
          court and have a Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise
          set forth in this Section 22(d)). The provisions of this Section 22
          shall constitute your and Fyndr’s written agreement to arbitrate
          Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“ Dispute Agreement ”).
          The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
          Association (“ AAA ”) and conducted before a single arbitrator
          pursuant to its rules, including, without limitation. The arbitrator
          will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable law and
          the facts, and issue a reasoned award, if appropriate. To begin an
          arbitration proceeding, you must submit the Dispute and simultaneously
          send a copy of the completed form to the following address: Fyndr LLC,
          3793 E Covey lane, Phoenix, AZ 85050. The arbitration will be
          conducted based upon written submissions unless you request, and/or
          the arbitrator determines, that a telephone or in-person hearing is
          necessary. In addition, you hereby unconditionally agree that (1) the
          arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by these Terms of Use and
          any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have
          entered into in connection with the Site; (2) the arbitrator shall
          apply Arizona law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of
          limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
          and (3) in the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the
          Dispute, you and the applicable Fyndr Entity(ies) shall agree to, or a
          court shall select, another arbitration provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          No Class Action Matters . We each agree that we shall bring any
          Dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and
          not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class,
          representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each
          agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis
          and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action and that
          the arbitrator may award relief (including injunctive relief) only on
          an individual basis. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary
          these provisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial . If for any reason a Dispute
          proceeds in court: (i) except with respect to a qualifying claim over
          a Dispute in a small claims court, which you shall have the right to
          bring in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you
          reside, you and Fyndr agree that any Dispute may only be instituted in
          a state or federal court in Maricopa County, Arizona; (ii) you and
          Fyndr irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal
          jurisdiction and venue of such courts for resolution of such Disputes;
          and (iii) you and Fyndr agree to waive any right to a trial by jury.
          You and Fyndr agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, the AAA rules,
          applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Arizona, without
          regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Dispute
          Agreement and any Disputes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Injunctive Relief . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
          Dispute Agreement, either party may bring suit in court seeking an
          injunction or other equitable relief arising out of or relating to the
          infringement of a party’s intellectual property, or any illegal or
          intentional act affecting the accessibility, functionality, or the
          security of the Site, and/or any illegal or intentional act against

          Section 22(b) above is ruled to be unenforceable, then the rest of
