            Fyndr has implemented an information security program that contains
            administrative, technical, and physical controls that are designed
            to reasonably safeguard personal information. For example, we use
            industry-standard encryption technology to secure financial account
            information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot
            guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about
            security on our Website, you can contact us at privacy@Fyndr.us.

            15. Google Calendar Permission

          <p>
            When users want to schedule appointments for specific campaigns or
            stores within the Fyndr webapp/app, they need to grant permission to
            access their Google Calendar and events. This permission enables the
            app to seamlessly integrate with their Google Calendar, allowing
            them to create events directly from the Fyndr webapp/app for their
            chosen campaign or store at the desired date and time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once users have granted permission for a particular appointment,
            such as scheduling a visit to a store or attending a campaign event,
            the app remembers this preference. Consequently, if users decide to
            explore other campaigns or stores and wish to schedule appointments
            for them, the app automatically extends the granted permission to
            these new selections. This streamlines the process for users,
            eliminating the need to repeatedly grant permission for each
            individual campaign or store they wish to schedule appointments for
            within the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, enabling Google Calendar and event permissions not only
            facilitates the creation of appointments within the Fyndr webapp/app
            but also ensures a seamless and efficient user experience by
            extending permission across multiple campaigns or stores as needed.
