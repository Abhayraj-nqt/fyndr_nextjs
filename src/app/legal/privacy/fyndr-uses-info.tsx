  15. Google Calendar Permission
</strong>
</div>
<div className={`${textSize}`}>
<p>
  When users want to schedule appointments for specific campaigns or
  stores within the Fyndr webapp/app, they need to grant permission to
  access their Google Calendar and events. This permission enables the
  app to seamlessly integrate with their Google Calendar, allowing
  them to create events directly from the Fyndr webapp/app for their
  chosen campaign or store at the desired date and time.
</p>
<p>
  Once users have granted permission for a particular appointment,
  such as scheduling a visit to a store or attending a campaign event,
  the app remembers this preference. Consequently, if users decide to
  explore other campaigns or stores and wish to schedule appointments
  for them, the app automatically extends the granted permission to
  these new selections. This streamlines the process for users,
  eliminating the need to repeatedly grant permission for each
  individual campaign or store they wish to schedule appointments for
  within the app.
</p>
<p>
  In essence, enabling Google Calendar and event permissions not only
  facilitates the creation of appointments within the Fyndr webapp/app
  but also ensures a seamless and efficient user experience by
  extending permission across multiple campaigns or stores as needed.
