            Fyndr has implemented an information security program that contains
            administrative, technical, and physical controls that are designed
            to reasonably safeguard personal information. For example, we use
            industry-standard encryption technology to secure financial account
            information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot
            guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about
            security on our Website, you can contact us at privacy@Fyndr.us.
