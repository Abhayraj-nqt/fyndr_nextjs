            Taxes Generally. It is Business&rsquo;s responsibility to determine
            what, if any, taxes apply to the payments Business makes or
            receives, and it is Business&rsquo;s responsibility to collect,
            report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.
            Fyndr is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to
            Business&rsquo;s transaction with either purchasers or Fyndr, or for
            collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any
            transaction with or by Business and purchaser. Business may be asked
            to provide Fyndr with a valid Tax Identification Number for tax
            reporting purposes. An IRS Form 1099 may be issued in
            Business&rsquo;s name for the value of payments made.
            Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Business shall be,
            and will remain, registered for sales, use and other similar tax
            collection purposes in all states and localities in which Business
            is required to be so registered in connection with the Business
            Offering and pursuant to the terms and redemption of the Offers, and
            shall be responsible for paying any and all sales, use or any other
            taxes related to the Business Offering or the goods and services.

            Transaction Taxes. Business bears sole financial responsibility for
            any and all sales, use, excise, general, GST, or other similar
            taxes, including any interest penalties and additions related
            thereto, imposed on or arising from the transactions contemplated by
            this Agreement between Fyndr and Business (&ldquo;Transaction
            Taxes&rdquo;), if any. Fyndr shall apply the applicable Transaction
            Tax to the amounts it retains and/or other fees remitted to Fyndr
            pursuant this Agreement. Transaction Taxes are calculated using the
            Business&rsquo;s billing address and will be included on invoices.
            Tax rates are subject to change. If applied, Transaction Taxes will
            be calculated at the time of each payment using the rates in effect
            under current law.

            Business shall use Customer Data only to fulfill its redemption
            obligations in connection with the Business Offering as authorized
            by this Agreement. Business expressly agrees that any Customer Data
            shall be used only for this purpose (including, but not limited to,
            the redemption of Offers and provision of goods and services to
            purchasers), and not to enhance a file or list owned by Business, or

            facilitate its redemption obligations hereunder, Business shall
            ensure that such third party implements and complies with reasonable
            security measures in handling any Customer Data. If any Customer
            Data is collected directly by Business or a third party engaged by

            Fyndr in the investigation of such breach and the mitigation of any
