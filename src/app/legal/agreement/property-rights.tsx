        Section 14 shall constitute Business&rsquo;s and Fyndr&rsquo;s written
        agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act. The
        arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association

        its applicable rules, including those applicable to Commercial Disputes,

        To begin an arbitration proceeding, Business or Fyndr must comply with
        the limitations provision set forth in Section 13 and submit the Dispute
        by making a demand for arbitration as detailed at http://www.adr.org. If
        Fyndr demands arbitration, it shall simultaneously send a copy of the
        completed demand to the Business&rsquo;s address of record. Payment of
        all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
        AAA&rsquo;s rules. Fyndr will reimburse those fees for Disputes totaling
        less than $3,000 if Business is the prevailing party in such
        arbitration. Fyndr will not seek attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in
        arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that a Business Dispute is
        frivolous. The arbitration will be conducted based upon written
        submissions unless Business requests and/or the arbitrator determines
        that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. If the arbitrator
        grants the request or determines an in-person hearing is necessary, the
